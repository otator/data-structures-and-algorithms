## Challenge_32
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
find the intersect nodes of two trees

traverse over the two trees using post order traversal and check if the both corresponding nodes have the same value.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
**space** complexity:
 **O(n)** for adding the common values in aa list



**Time** Complexity
visiting each node of the trees -> **O(n)**
